      <h1> Michael Holley</h1>
  <h2> Bio </h2>

  <p> I'm 17 years old and a Junior in high school at Queens Tech. My favorite hobbies are playing sports, more specifically basketball and baseball, as well as playing video games and working on computers when I can. I live in Astoria NY with my small yet rowdy family consisting of my mom, my dad, and my sister. <br> <br>I am a high honor roll student who works hard to earn high grades and maintain my GPA. I love learning about networking in my shop class and certainly see myself being a software engineer or a cyber security analyst of some sort. Last but not least I am eager to learn more about these various coding languages and can't wait to expand my skill set.</p>
